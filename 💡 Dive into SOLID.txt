💡 Dive into SOLID principles for rock-solid software design! 🏗️

🔍 Single Responsibility: Each class should have only one reason to change. Keep it focused!

🚪 Open/Closed: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Embrace new features without altering existing code.

↔️ Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. Avoid surprises when using derived classes.

📦 Interface Segregation: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. Keep your interfaces tailored and cohesive.

🔗 Dependency Inversion: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions. Stay flexible and decoupled!
